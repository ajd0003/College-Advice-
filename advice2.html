  <p><strong>Balance Over Burnout:</strong></p>
  <p>In high school, it’s normal to take six or seven classes at the same time without breaking a sweat. In college, the average student takes either four or five classes. Classes are a lot different in college because they carry a lot more baggage than they seem. A class that only meets for three hours a week may expect you to complete more than double this amount of time in homework and reading. Multiply that by four or five classes and your week is full.</p>
  <p>In the fall of my sophomore year, I took five classes, including anatomy and physiology, organic chemistry, and calculus, and I struggled to stay afloat. Also, finals week that semester was absolutely horrible. If I could go back and do it again, I would shift one of those heavier courses to another semester.</p>
  <p>Some students brag about filling their schedule with the maximum amount of credits allowed by the university, but ask them how they’re doing once midterms roll around, and again during finals. Additionally, some classes require more out-of-class work than others. My biochemistry class definitely required more of me than my nutrition class, but French took more of my time than I had expected. You won’t know exactly how much work a class is until you’re in it.</p>
  <p>Lastly, project-based classes can sneak up on you. You’ll be cruising for most of the semester until the week before your project is due, then you’re spending every waking moment trying to complete it.</p>
  <p>During your first semester of classes, you’re not just learning the content in your classes, but you’re learning how to function as a college student. This includes figuring out how to study, what your academic strengths and weaknesses are, and the importance of soft skills like time management and organization. I truly figured out how to be the best student I can be during my junior year, so it can take time, but I know you’ll rise to the challenge.</p>
