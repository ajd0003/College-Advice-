  <h1 class="title">Studying for Finals?</h1>
  <p>Finals week will be a new experience for you. Basically, each of your professors will decide whether or not to host a final exam. Some classes prefer a final project or essay to close out the course, but, in my experience, a lot of general education courses give final exams. I’m not sure how heavily your aviation courses will rely on exam grades, but this advice applies to anything requiring studying.</p>

  <p>In college, you do not get to retake exams for full credit. In fact, there are no retakes. This is why it is crucial you learn how to study. To study effectively is a skill in itself, and that skill will be tested during heavy midterm weeks or finals week. My first piece of advice for learning how to study is this: use the first exam or quiz to gauge the type of questions asked. I know this doesn’t really help you study for the first exam, but I promise it’s helpful for your long term success in that class.</p>

  <p>Some classes will give out exams that are mainly memorization. In my experience, these classes move quickly through material. For me, this included anatomy and physiology and biochemistry. While I still needed a complex understanding of the material, many of the exam questions primarily focused on recalling names and vocabulary. Even when thinking about physiological or biochemical mechanisms, I still had to memorize all the pieces first, before understanding the content on a larger scale. If you take a class that relies heavily on memorization, I suggest Quizlet flashcards. This has been a tried and true method for me over the years. It can be a pain to create a flashcard deck for each exam, but I find even making the cards improves my memorization and understanding of the material. Sometimes I’ll make a deck for an exam last minute, the day before, but still have a good understanding of the content due to making the cards and running through them at least once.</p>

  <p>Another style of studying that I have found works for me is writing down all the material with pen on paper. This is a bit of a catch-all studying style. It works for memorizing terms, but also for more complex content. I use this method to visualize exactly how much work I need to do. In large classes, professors will typically post their lecture slides online and I would flip through all the slides relevant to the upcoming exam and write everything down. While this method doesn’t necessarily involve active recall, like flashcards, it makes the content more digestible. If I have a problem translating the lecture slides into my own words, I know I need to focus on that material during studying. Also, writing down information helps with memorization anyways.</p>

  <p>For exams based around short-answer questions or math questions, I typically rely on YouTube videos and practice questions. There are so many wonderful accounts on YouTube that follow common university courses. During calculus, physics, and organic chemistry, to name a few, I would spend hours watching videos about the exam topics. Every person online covers the material in a different way, so it might help you think about the topics in a way that makes sense to you.</p>

  <p>Overall, just remember that exams are a big deal in college. During your first year, each exam will help you hone in on which studying styles work best for you. There are also plenty more ways to study than what I have outlined here. Lastly, finals week can be rough. Make sure to get enough sleep, eat well, and spread out your studying sessions.</p>
