  <h1 class="title">A Student’s Best Friend</h1>
  <p>Each of your professors will give you a syllabus, detailing the week by week schedule of the class. These usually include exam dates, assignment deadlines, and lecture topics. Write down all the due dates before the end of syllabus week.</p>
  <p>I have found that making a chronological spreadsheet with every single assignment, exam, and project due during the semester helps me stay organized and complete everything. It’s important to stay in-the-know; most professors do not care if you missed an assignment because you are disorganized or forgot.</p>
