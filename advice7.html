  <h1 class="title">Here to Stay or Gone Tomorrow?</h1>
  <p>One of the most important pieces of knowledge I can pass on is that people come and go. Your life is like a revolving door – some people enter it and take one pass through before heading back out, while others take a few laps before choosing whether to stay or go. Either way, this is alright.</p>
  <p>The best friends you have now may be different by the time you’re a sophomore and different again by senior year. You will meet people in your classes every semester, and talk two or three times a week, and then never speak again once the final is done. You will make friends in clubs or through a job, but never see them again after graduation.</p>
  <p>Let people enter your life and decide whether or not they want to stay. Take what they have to offer you and expect nothing more from them. Everyone is on their own path, especially in college, and people making the decision about whether or not you will remain friends can be a blessing in disguise.</p>
  <p>Move with grace and wish them well if they want to say goodbye. Those who appreciate who you truly are will stick around. This doesn’t mean that you should never go the extra mile to become friends with someone, or to stay friends, but understand that the people who are meant to stay in your life, will.</p>
