  <h1 class="title">To Skip or Not to Skip</h1>
  <p>The age old question: Should you skip class?</p>
  <p>This debate has plagued college students for centuries, but unfortunately the answer is more complex than a yes or no. I would be a hypocrite if I told you to go to every single class for all four years. I would also be a hypocrite if I told you to only skip class when you were sick. In fact, I don’t think I stepped foot in my freshman biology lecture once. I didn’t even know where the classroom was. I also skipped quite a few organic chemistry lectures because I could not stand to listen to my professor read directly from the slides. I’ve skipped my fair share of classes over the years, but you need to understand the potential consequences of skipping class before falling into a bad habit.</p>
  <p>There are plenty of reasons to skip class, from needing extra sleep to attending something fun instead. I have also skipped class to catch up on work or study for an exam for another class. The problem with “productive skipping” is you fall into a vicious cycle. You get your work done for the class in question, but then you fall behind in the class you skipped. It’s important to understand the present and future results of missing an entire class of material. If there’s an exam or project coming up, it is not a good idea to skip. Professors tend to review material the week of an exam or at least answer questions from students that will also help you. Additionally, many professors suck at making slideshows that are coherent to anyone but themselves. The amount of nights I’ve been up late studying, staring at slides that make no sense, is concerning. Going to the lecture helps you fill in the gaps that the slideshows are missing. However, some professors post-COVID record their lectures and post them online. It is very tempting to skip class and watch a pre-recorded lecture instead, but if I had a nickel for every time I said I’d watch the lecture and never got around to it, I’d have at least a dollar. I suggest if you are able to make it to class, just suck it up and go. It’ll help you in the long run and prevent late night cramming sessions of material you’re learning for the first time. Regardless, you’re in charge of your education and will get as much out of it as you put into it.</p>
