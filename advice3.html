  <h1 class="title">Textbooks & Tribulations</h1>
  <p><strong>A word to the wise and to your wallet</strong>, do not buy a textbook unless you are 100% sure there is no alternative option. When a class claims to require a textbook, my first course of action is to scour the internet for a free PDF. You’ll be surprised how many textbooks are available online for free.</p>
  <p>If you are completely unable to find it online, try to purchase it used. The bookstore on campus might sell used copies for a discounted price. Regardless, do not purchase a textbook until you have sat in the class. I tend not to buy a textbook for a class until we need it for an assignment.</p>
  <p>Some professors add a required textbook to the syllabus, but never grade you based on readings or textbook questions. Sometimes, no matter how much you don’t want to buy a new textbook, you have no choice. Some of the books I’ve had to purchase over the years have included online permission codes to access graded homework, which sounds, and is, cruel.</p>
  <p>Do not buy a textbook unless it includes access to graded assessments or you actually need it and can’t find it for free. There’s usually a way around purchasing textbooks, you just have to search hard enough.</p>
