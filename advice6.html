  <h1 class="title">“Yes” Now, Sleep Later</h1>
  <p>This is advice for the rest of your life, not just college. During your freshman year, the semesters may run long as you count down until the weekend, but I promise the expiration date of college sneaks up on you.</p>
  <p>With this in mind, I wholeheartedly want you to try new activities and find yourself in situations where you simply can’t believe what is happening. The ability to say “yes” is one that too many people push to the side, opting for a consistent, predictable “no” instead.</p>
  <p>There have been many nights where I’ve wanted to say “no” to a party, gathering, or adventure because of an early class or lack of desire to leave my room, but I try to say yes as much as I can. I want you to do the same.</p>
  <p>By saying “yes” I’ve found myself playing college ice hockey, staying up until 3am with my roommate to drink wine and play card games (I definitely skipped my 8am the next morning), and sitting around a bonfire in the middle of the woods with strangers.</p>
  <p>Even if you don’t have a good time, at least you have a new story to tell. Life consists of a bunch of moving parts and every person has something interesting to offer you. Take what’s thrown in your direction and build the plot of your future stories.</p>
